A minimal React.js template for building quick and easy personal sites with Parallax.

## Getting Started
1. clone or fork this project on your local machine
2. `npm install`
3. `npm dev` ( if you want to launch `webpack-dev-server` and take a look at how the template looks in your browser at `localhost:8080` )

## Customizing
This is a simple, single-page React app. If you have a basic understanding about React and ReactDOM you should know where to start.

The React source code is under `/src` and all bundled code and assets will live in `/public`. If you want to begin editing, go ahead and start in `/src/index.js`.

You will see some inline styling on React components for layout purposes. Any Parallax-specific styling lives in `/public/style.css`.

## Building
`npm run build` will bundle your React code and output to `/public/bundle.js`.
